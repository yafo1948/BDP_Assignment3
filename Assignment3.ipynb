    "### Summary:\n",
    "In general, moving from local to cloud, and local hardware to serverless has many advantages in speed, efficiency, fault-tolerance, and reliability, which is why more & more work has migrated in this direction ove the last 5-10 years. Using serverless invocations for both the Map and Reduce tasks enables the use of cloud computing infrastructure, improving speed and efficiency and reducing the need for local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in Step 1 we still run the shuffle step locally, on the SQL database located on our machine. This is a crucial step in MapReduce, and downloading all that data from the cloud to the local machine, performing the shuffle, and then invoking the Reduce step and sending the data back to the cloud, really compromises a lot of the benefits of running the Map & Reduce steps on the cloud. This can cause local memory issues and slow down the entire engine and output. Uploading all the data to the cloud and running the operations there, but then needing to download all the data to do the shuffle locally also just doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a workflow standpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- don't need to pay as much, in theory, since the shuffle step is resource-intensive and is being run locally. However, this is only theory, as needing to download the data and run the shuffle locally could just as well end up costing more, either in direct costs of energy / bandwidth / compute, and/or indirect costs of affecting the performance of the local machine and/or other tasks.\n",
    "- Localizing the shuffle step may provide more control or degrees of freedom to customize in some phases of the engine, if cloud provider doesn't allow certain actions or parameters that are important and specific to the desired design of the shuffle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- Big Data: the larger the amount of data being handled by the MapReduceEngine, the more strain the local shuffle step puts on the local machine, especially when it's a laptop as it is in our case. Even with the assumption of using some super-powerful local machine, the limits of the amount of data it can handle and the amount of bandwidth for downloading the data and \"sending back\", are all finite, and pale in comparison to the scalability of utilizing cloud computing infrastructure.\n",
    "- Failure & Fault-tolerance: regardless of the type of local machine, having the shuffle step handled locally increases the level of communication between the local machine and the cloud computing infrastructure, and more communication and coordination by default increases the possibilities and probabilities of encountering some failures along the way. This speaks to the \"cost\" savings we discussed above as a potential theoretical pro - as those savings could be trivial compared to the cost of failures.\n",
    "- Losing benefits of serverless invocations of Map & Reduce, as the overall complexity of the operation will be driven by the slowest part of the chain, meaning no matter how much we gain in efficiency and fault-tolerance by running Map & Reduce on the cloud, the limitations of performing the shuffle locally (and the required transfer of the data to & from the local server) can and likely will drown out the gains from the serverless execution of Map & Reduce. As can be seen in the diagram below, there is no way around the shuffle step - it will by default be a rate-limiting step...\n",

    "### Summary:\n",
    "The best way to improve the shuffle step and streamline the entire engine in the cloud will involve some version of localizing the mapped data database to the cloud (SQL or otherwise) in object storage (including a choice about whether it should be in the same bucket or a separate one), and modifying the shuffle function itself to conform to being a serverless action in the cloud environment, and to the specifications of the cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- enables much greater potential scalability for larger projects and big data\n",
    "    - also enables using hybrid shuffle where slow and fast storage can be utilized when appropriate, and big-data shuffles can be partitioned into smaller chunks or rounds (*see image below).\n",
    "- no need to manage local hardware / infrastructure, equipment, processing power, and most importantly, storage\n",
    "- the entire engine is \"under one roof\", the data stays in one place, and any debugging and troubleshooting can be more efficient as it's all in the same common infrastructure.\n",
    "    - fault-tolerance would be more reliable as the cloud service provider certainly has backup covered\n",
    "- as a result, there is potential for a better cost-performance trade-off than would otherwise be achieved with the local shuffle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- potentially higher overall absolute cost. The relative cost could still be more worthwhile, but depending on the project and the data in question, a higher overall cost may be overkill and not the best use of resources\n",
    "- potentially decreased customizability\n",
    "- for very simple tasks in accessing the data, the latency would be higher and could take longer on the cloud when compared to running locally, for that very specific finite task.\n",
    "- increasing the burden on the serverless engine and adding more and more functions comes with its own risks, in communication and coordination of functions, and depending on the amount of and type of functions, and the serverless engine's capabilities and development, this could create additional unwanted complexity.\n",
    "- the fault-tolerance, error-rate, latency, and run-time would all be beholden to the functioning of the cloud infrastructure and servers. This can lead to situations that are out of the user's control compared to handling things on a local server/machine and having full control and transparency into everything."

    "Yes, serverless shuffle IS possible. Can be done by creating an SQL database in object storage and then performing the shuffle in a similiar but serverless-conforming function. Alternatively, we could bypass SQL and write code that will handle the mapped data and perform the same shuffle & sort functionality. This can be done using the lithops call_async method (see references below) to dramatically simplify and reduce steps required. However, it is not a slam-dunk that this would be worthwhile, as it could consume more resources than are absolutely necessary, and also because of the shuffle being so critical to MapReduce and being inter-connected to both Map & Reduce sides, there is potential to complicate the workflow and reduce the efficiency of the overall engine, depending on a lot of other factors.\n",
